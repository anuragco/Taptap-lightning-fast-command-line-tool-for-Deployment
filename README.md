# Taptap CLI

A lightning-fast command-line tool for deploying static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript projects to remote servers with zero configuration hassle.

## Description

Taptap CLI is designed to streamline the deployment process for front-end developers and students working on static web projects. With a single command, you can deploy your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a remote server, making it perfect for showcasing projects, assignments, or prototypes.

The tool automatically detects your project structure, filters relevant files, packages them securely, and deploys them via API - all while keeping your workflow clean and efficient.

```bash
npm install -g taptap-cli

## File Inclusion & Exclusion Rules

### ‚úÖ Included Files
- `.html` files (e.g., `index.html`)
- `.css` files (stylesheets)
- `.js` files (JavaScript)
- Image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.svg`, `.webp`)
- Video files (`.mp4`, `.webm`, `.ogg`)
- Font files (`.woff`, `.woff2`, `.ttf`, `.otf`)
- JSON files (`.json`)
- Media assets necessary for front-end rendering

### ‚ùå Excluded Files
- Hidden files and directories (starting with `.`)
- `node_modules/` directory
- `.git/` directory
- Log files (`.log`, `.logs`)
- Archive files (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.tar`, etc.)
- Markdown files (`.md`, `.markdown`)
- Files with malformed names (e.g., `index.html,style.css`)
- Any files that don't match the allowed or recognized extensions


## Deployment Process

### What Happens During Deployment

1. **Project Detection**: Scans current directory for `index.html` file
2. **File Filtering**: Collects only `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files based on inclusion rules
3. **Temporary Packaging**: Creates a `tempdeploy/` folder and copies filtered files
4. **Compression**: Zips the temporary folder for efficient transfer
5. **API Upload**: Sends the zip file to the deployment server
6. **URL Generation**: Receives the live site URL from the server
7. **Cleanup**: Removes temporary folder and zip file

### After Deployment

- Your site is live at the provided URL
- All temporary files are automatically cleaned up
- You receive confirmation of successful deployment
- **Sites remain active for 120 days** (unless you have a support token)

## Site Management

### Viewing Deployments from Server
Use `taptap --deploy-list` to fetch all your past deployments from the remote server. You'll see each site's URL and inspection link.

### Viewing Local Deployment Logs
Use `taptap --logs` to review deployment history stored locally on your system.

### Previewing Before Deploy
Use `taptap --preview` to launch a local development server and test your site before deploying it live.

### Deleting Deployments
Use `taptap --delete` to permanently remove a deployed site from the server.

### Opening the Latest Deployment
Use `taptap --open` to instantly open your most recent deployment in the default browser.

## Error Handling

Taptap CLI provides clear error messages for common issues:

- Missing `index.html` file in current directory
- Network connectivity problems
- Server-side deployment errors
- File permission issues

## Development Requirements

Your project should have:
- An `index.html` file in the root directory
- Valid HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript files
- Proper file naming (avoid special characters and malformed names)

## Example Project Structure

```
my-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html ‚úÖ Included
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css ‚úÖ Included
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js ‚úÖ Included

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No index.html found**: Ensure you're in the correct project directory with an `index.html` file.

**Deployment failed**: Check your internet connection and try again.

**Site went down**: If your site is no longer accessible after 120 days, you'll need to redeploy or contact support for a token.

## Extended Hosting

For sites that need to stay live longer than 120 days, contact support to obtain a token. With a support token, your deployments will have extended hosting without the automatic takedown.
